# Description
This project represents the model's work performance that make the low-resolution faces images into high-resolution ones, starting with the images with shape `64x64` on inputs and ending up with shape `256x256` on outputs after applying CNN model. The main goal is to reach the best performance on test data with low losses and high accuracy and plot the obtained results to see how good the images look to human vision.
# Dataset

For successful model tuning the [Flickr-Faces-HQ Dataset (FFHQ)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnaud58/flickrfaceshq-dataset-ffhq) was used for current project. It contains over 50.000 images with resolution `512x512`.
